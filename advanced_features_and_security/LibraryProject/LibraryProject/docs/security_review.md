# Security Configuration Review â€“ LibraryProject

## Summary of Changes

### HTTPS Enforcement:

- Enabled `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` to force HTTPS.
- Enabled HSTS with `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, and `PRELOAD`.

### Secure Cookies:

- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` ensure cookie security.

### HTTP Headers:

- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` to protect against clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` and `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` to prevent XSS and MIME sniffing.

## Deployment Notes

- Configured Nginx with Let's Encrypt certificates.
- All HTTP requests are now redirected to HTTPS.

## Recommendations

- Regularly rotate SSL certificates.
- Perform periodic vulnerability scans.
- Consider adding Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for further protection.
